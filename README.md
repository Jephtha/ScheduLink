MUN ScheduLink
A project for COMP 4768: Intro to Software Development for Mobile Devices

This software provides a platform that generates a schedule for students of MUN after inputting their
specified courses. User profiles are created allowing students to connect with others in the
same courses.
This software will also provide course information for each course offered and added to the
userâ€™s schedule relative to their current semester.
In addition, it will be used as a social platform where students can interact on topics,
assignments and more, once a connection request is established and confirmed; allowing
students to consent to sharing or exchanging contact information providing the opportunity to
form deeper social connections.
